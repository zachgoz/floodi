# Note: Do not commit your real .env with secrets to version control.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values locally.

# After configuring your Web App, enable Authentication providers:
# - Email/Password
# - Anonymous (for guest access and conversion to registered accounts)

# Firestore
# - Firestore is automatically initialized by the app when Firebase config is set.
# - You must enable Firestore in Firebase Console:
#   Console > Build > Firestore Database > Create database
#   Choose Production mode and a region close to your users.
# - Remember to deploy security rules and indexes (requires Firebase CLI):
#   firebase deploy --only firestore
# - See firestore.rules and firestore.indexes.json for this projectâ€™s configuration.
